# car-holder-plus

A simple model that upgrades the center console cup holder from one small cup holder to two medium-large cup holders with a slot at either end for a phone
Tested against late 90s toyota models, you can adjust the cup holder size via these params in the openscad file:
$in_car_cup_holder_height = 65;$in_car_holder_top_diameter = 74;$in_car_bottom_diameter = 66.5;

Project file includes:
- Cup Adapter without cut - an “All-in-on” print - uses more supports & time, stronger, with no assembly (~21h print time & 560g of PLA filament)
- Cut the Cup Adapter with a dowel cut - Minimise print/build time via splitting the cup holder to a separate part (~14h print time & 450g of PLA filament) - Parametric .scad file for customisation 


v1.1- Making the cup shorter and wider at the top (remove the need for tape)- Slightly narrower cup holder diameter at the brim and base- Reduce sharp edges (better align cup & phone holders in the center)
